README
generateBoolSolvability.m is the matlab file. It is a normal script, and assumes A is an existing adjacency matrix. Changing the value of k changes the boolean expression generated, which is the input file to MiniSAT named 'kcolorsboolsolability.txt'. These comments are also in the script as a comment.

matrix_31.txt is the original adjacency matrix from professor Finn.

TS3521kAns.txt is the file with the least k colors answer.
